# Smart-Fractionalized-NFT _ Concept/Draft version
Smart NFT - Fractionalized sharing

Problem - Goods Sharing
Typically sharing of assets occurs by subscribing to a centralized service.
There is an entity that owns the assets. The users rent the right of usage using a subscription. 
For example a centralized car sharing service.
Allthough the concept benefits society, the users have no ownership of the good themselves. 

Custodial Bridge.
An NFT often represents a digital good or service, since custody is easy to connect to it and proof on the blockchain.
If the token represents or owns physical goods or services, there needs to be a custodial bridge.
An example is the museum that keeps a physical painting, while it is tokenized and sold as an NFT.
To have this third party introduces centralization. If ensures the Bridge between the physical object and the digital ownership.

Solution
To form a digital entity that is tokenized,fractionally owned and legally recognized as a body. 
It can take automated, or limited action and keep physical objects. 
Example: a community (street) own pieces of a smart nft. This NFT is a foundation.
It is programmed to buy and sell a car every 6 years. It recieves and sends out maintenance and usage requests.
It pays out to repairshops and charges its owners.

Custody is more decentralized , and ownership is fractionalized
The usage sharing schedule can be as simplex or complex as needed. It may or may not be part of the smart nft..
